# my-first-wp-plugin
The first plugin I made during my first developer job - not refactor - archived - just to remember !

#### Context : 
A change of CMS lead me to build a new directory plugin in order to handle the old postgre database with the new mysql wordpress database.

I was working alone in the web pole so I have to find out all the informations to make it without the help of a senior dev (thank you Browser!).

I say this because I know the code is far from perfect. I make choices among all the informations of "how to do a plugin" on the web. Maybe (probably!) not the best ones.

But at the end of my contract I delivered a plugin which was working, I tested it and I deployed it on the wordpress websites.

And it still working 2 years after...so not that bad for a first shot I guess :)

* It is not refactored. It won't be. 
* I just changed some name and delete some datas.
* I gonna keep it that way to remind me the progess I made on my developer journey.
