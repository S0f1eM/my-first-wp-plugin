## Introduction

This is the first plugin I made. It is a plugin to show employee's data on the new wordpress websites.   
There is a filter on the laboratories and a dynamic search bar for people's names.  
It was made during my first developer job.  
* HTML / CSS / PHP / MySQL / JavaScript

## Context<a name="context"></a> 

During a rebuild project I was managing the change of CMS lead me to build a new directory plugin in order to handle the old postgre database with the new mysql wordpress database.

For explaining the context a bit more, I was working alone in the web pole so I have to find out the informations to build a wordpress plugin without "a dev" help (thank you Browser!). I make choices among all the informations of "how to do a plugin" on the web. So maybe some of them were not the best ones.   
But at the end of my contract I delivered my first plugin and it was working, I tested it and I deployed it on the wordpress websites.

And it still working 2 years after...so not that bad for a first shot I guess :)

* It is not refactored. It won't be. 
* I just changed and deleted some datas.
* I keep it that way to remind me the progess I made on my developer journey.
